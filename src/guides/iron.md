# Iron farms

## Early games

### Ianxofour's Instant Iron Farm

<YouTube id="-oYyJ6jfSPU" />

::: tip
Watch the video carefully, be sure to check the video description and if something isn't working, take a screenshot and ask on Ianxofour Discord Server.

::: details Some ways you can upgrade this farm (beside the method shown in the video):
    1. Build 4 farms, with a gap of 9 blocks horizontally between each killing platform:

    2. Use lava cauldron or move both the chest + hopper down 1 block, place soul sand on top of the hopper with a wither flower (not pratical)

    3. Drop iron golem down about 30 blocks and then set up a killing chamber there

## Mid game

### Compact 16 pod by MineTheFab

This farm use nether portal to send iron golem to the nether and kill them there, though collecting item in the overworld is kinda frustrating, u should check both video description and comments for fixes (Check MTF discord as well)

### The Iron Beast

This farm is pretty similar to the one mentioned above though collecting system is fairly easy.

## Late game (may overkill)

### Nubtech VUAIF v2

<YouTube id="Y0VBqKrY9Js" />

This one probally overkill for singleplayer, though it looks pretty cool. Be sure to check out Nubtech discord
